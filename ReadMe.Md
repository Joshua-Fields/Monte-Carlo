# Distributed Mandelbrot Fractal Renderer

This project demonstrates **distributed processing** by rendering the Mandelbrot fractal across multiple **Dask** workers. It splits the image into tiles, distributes each tile's computation to different workers, and then combines the tiles into a final image.

## Introduction

**The Mandelbrot set** is a famous fractal generated by iterating a simple function in the complex plane. At high resolutions or deep zooms, rendering can be very computationally intensive. This project speeds up the rendering process by using **distributed computing** with [Dask](https://dask.org/).

## Why Distributed Processing?

- **Parallel Tasks**: Instead of computing every pixel in one process, we split the work into “tiles.”  
- **Scale Across Machines**: Dask can coordinate multiple *workers* (processes) on one machine or *multiple* machines over a network.  
- **Faster Results**: More workers = more parallel computing power, reducing the time to render high-resolution or deep-zoom fractals.

## Project Structure

```
monte_carlo_py.py   # Main script that coordinates the rendering
README.md                   # This README file
requirements.txt            # (Optional) Requirements file if you choose to create one
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (Recommended)
- Dask (and its distributed module)
- Pillow (for image creation and saving)
- NumPy

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```
3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install dask[distributed] pillow numpy
   ```
   *(You can also install from `requirements.txt` if provided.)*

## Usage

### 1. Start the Dask Scheduler

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
dask-scheduler
```
The scheduler will print an address (commonly `tcp://127.0.0.1:8786`). **Keep this terminal open**.

### 2. Start One or More Workers

In one or more additional terminals, run:
```bash
dask-worker tcp://127.0.0.1:8786
```
- Each worker connects to the scheduler.
- You can start multiple workers on the same machine or on different machines (pointing them to the scheduler's IP if not local).

### 3. Run the Fractal Renderer Script

In **another** terminal:
```bash
python monte_carlo_py.py
```
**Output**:
- The script connects to the Dask scheduler, distributes the computation of fractal “tiles” to each worker, and waits for them to finish.
- Once complete, a file named `mandelbrot.png` is saved in the project directory.

## Configuration

You can edit the parameters at the bottom of `monte_carlo_py.py`:

```python
# Region of the complex plane
XMIN, XMAX = -2.0, 1.0
YMIN, YMAX = -1.0, 1.0

# Image resolution
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 1920, 1080

# Tiling
TILES_ACROSS = 4
TILES_DOWN   = 4

# Iterations
MAX_ITER = 300
```

- **(XMIN, XMAX) and (YMIN, YMAX)**: The region of the complex plane to render.
- **WIDTH, HEIGHT**: Final image resolution in pixels.
- **TILES_ACROSS, TILES_DOWN**: How many tiles to split the image into horizontally and vertically.
- **MAX_ITER**: Maximum iterations for testing each pixel’s divergence (increases detail but also compute time).

## How It Works

1. **Tiling**: The script splits the final image into `tiles_across * tiles_down` tiles. Each tile covers a sub-region of the complex plane.
2. **Distributed Computation**: Each tile is computed by a remote or local *worker* via `client.submit()`.  
3. **Combining Results**: The main script gathers the results with `client.gather()`, then stitches all tile arrays into one large 2D array.
4. **Color Mapping**: The script applies a colorization function to map iteration counts to RGB values.
5. **Final Image**: The result is saved as `mandelbrot.png`.

**Key Point**: The **distributed** nature is most visible when you have multiple workers (potentially on multiple machines). Each worker calculates a portion of the image in parallel, demonstrating how Dask coordinates tasks and aggregates results.

## Tips & Customization

- **Zoom In**: Narrow the ranges (e.g., `XMIN = -0.75`, `XMAX = -0.65`) to explore interesting “zoom” areas of the Mandelbrot set.
- **Increase Resolution**: For more detailed images, try `WIDTH=3840`, `HEIGHT=2160` (4K). Expect longer computation times!
- **Experiment with Tiles**: Adjust `TILES_ACROSS` and `TILES_DOWN` for more, smaller tiles. This often balances the workload better across workers.
- **Customize Color**: Modify the `colorize(...)` function to experiment with different color schemes or even incorporate matplotlib’s color maps.
- **Scale the Cluster**: Launch more workers or scale across different machines to see the power of distributed computing in speeding up the rendering process.
